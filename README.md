## Project overview
auth-web provides core authentication functionality (sign-up, sign-in, session management, token issuance/validation) intended to be used as a standalone service or embedded into larger applications. The project focuses on clear APIs, secure defaults, and extensibility.

## Features
- Email/password authentication
- Token-based sessions (JWT)
- Refresh token support
- Secure password hashing
- Role-based access control hooks
- Pluggable persistence layer
- Basic rate limiting for auth endpoints

## Requirements
- Node.js >= 18 (or alternative runtime specified by project)
- Package manager: npm or yarn
- A database (Postgres, MySQL, SQLite or other supported adapter)
- Optional: SMTP service for email verification and password reset

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    git clone <repo-url>
2. Install dependencies:
    cd auth-web
    npm install

## Configuration
Create a .env file or populate environment variables required by the application. Example variables:
- PORT=3000
- NODE_ENV=development
- DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/authdb
- JWT_SECRET=replace-with-secure-secret
- JWT_EXPIRES_IN=15m
- REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRES_IN=30d
- SMTP_HOST=
- SMTP_PORT=
- SMTP_USER=
- SMTP_PASS=
- RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS=60000
- RATE_LIMIT_MAX=100

Replace values with secure secrets in production and store them securely (e.g., vault, secrets manager).

## Development
Start the development server with automatic reload (if configured):
npm run dev

Common scripts (update package.json as needed):
- start: start production server
- dev: start development server (with watcher)
- build: compile/prepare for production
- lint: run linter
- test: run test suite

## Testing
Run unit and integration tests:
npm test

Use environment-specific configuration or test database to avoid polluting development/production data.

## Deployment
- Build the application (if applicable): npm run build
- Configure environment variables in the deployment environment
- Use a process manager (pm2, systemd) or container orchestration (Docker, Kubernetes)
- Ensure secure TLS termination and proper network policies
- Rotate secrets and enforce least privilege for service accounts

## Security
- Use strong, randomly generated JWT_SECRET and store it securely
- Enable HTTPS in production
- Limit login attempts and implement rate limiting
- Store passwords using bcrypt/argon2 with appropriate work factor
- Validate and sanitize input for all endpoints
- Keep dependencies updated and run security scans
